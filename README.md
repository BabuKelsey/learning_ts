# updates
- 1.4.0
    - working with more objects and referencing (kinda neat but i think im just doing oop cus im used to it xD)
    - the "crappyGame" is basically an eye level look at how guns in destiny 2 regenerates ammo
        - still lacking a progress bar per kill 
            - ie; 1 kill of enemy type(rank&file/major/ultra) * by ammo regen -> if > 100, give ammo and reset running total. else add to running total
- 1.3.2
    - objects and stuff (oop shid)

- 1.3.1
    - just seeing some stuff with json

- 1.3.0
    - tuples.ts
        - apparently they're faster than json? and strict/fixed
