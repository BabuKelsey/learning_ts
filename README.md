# typescript goals
 to host on github pages at some point (html + ts)

 hopefully have a simple/extremely barebones calculator

 honestly idk what ts is used for yet

# TODO
- in crappy game tm
    - simple addition - consider the ammo type in ammo gen
    - to do (add css for fun at some point)
    - maybe use destiny 2's api for fun and see what i can make from there - but in a new repo
    - still lacking a progress bar per kill
        - ie; 1 kill of enemy type(rank&file/major/ultra) * by ammo regen -> if > 100, give ammo and reset running total. else add to running total

# updates
- 1.5.2
    - destiny 2 based ammo calculator thingy's input is working (yipee!!!)..

See the full update history in [changelog](./changelog.md).
