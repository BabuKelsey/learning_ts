# updates
- 1.5.1
    - made a form return a user's input - which means i should be able to get 1.4 to work with a bit of tinkering (i hope)
    
- 1.5.0
    - simple user return working, now to somehow make it work with said thing below..

        - drop down text is unreadable (color issue)
        - no return data..

- 1.4.0
    - working with more objects and referencing (kinda neat but i think im just doing oop cus im used to it xD)
    - the "crappyGame" is basically an eye level look at how guns in destiny 2 regenerates ammo
        - still lacking a progress bar per kill 
            - ie; 1 kill of enemy type(rank&file/major/ultra) * by ammo regen -> if > 100, give ammo and reset running total. else add to running total
        - needs a way to input the guns and their ammo regen numbers
